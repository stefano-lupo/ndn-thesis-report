\chapter{Design}
Explain the things MOGs must do 

\section{Player Discovery}

\section{Sync Protocol}
Broadcast names (for discovery etc) need multicast forwarding strategy
\subsection{Differences from existing protocols}
outstanding interest catchup, only one writer
\subsection{Naming Design}

\section{Interaction}
This is not handled in Egal Car

\section{Optimizations to Sync Protocol for Data types}
\subsection{PLayer Status}
\subsection{Projectile}

\section{Game Design}
\subsection{Protos}
\subsection{Very brief game functionality}
\subsection{Linkage between game and backend}
diagrams of pubs / subs / game engine
\subsection{Optimizations}
\subsection*{Interest Zone Filtering}
\subsection*{Dead Reckoning}
Dead reckoning impacted by caching? E.g. getting someone else's dead reckoned packet? Stefan mentioned this I cant decide if it matters right now

\subsection{Automation Script}
Must be repeatable, used fixed seed for RNG

Things can't be parametrized in NDN without forming a gross name schema - e.g. interaction API can't send parameters. Potential solution is to have publisher's maintain outstanding interests towards consumers for interactions?
