\chapter{Evaluation}
Key things to examine: scale, overhead (packet size vs app data), latency
Evaluation Matrix
Push to breaking point

In order to examine the performance of the game, \dots

Need to decide what game objects to use

\subsection{Round Trip Times}
As a bench mark, no caching, no DR, no IZF RTT for each topology

\subsection{Effects of Enabling Caching}
Discuss difficulties of maintaining fresh cache in MOG scenario where data changes are not predictable (freshness period etc), tree topology makes G should never really be getting any cache hits cause any data that is cached at G should have been forwarded to one of the intermediate routers who would then cache the data. For Dumbbell the intermediate routers should only be caching data on the OPPOSITE SIDE? If an interest arrives at F for C/D, it will be cached at F on the way back. However once it reaches E it will be cached there too. If A or B  then request the interest it should be cached and served from E not from F. 
As in-network caching is one of the main benefits of NDN for typical use cases such a serving content, the impacts of using caching for the MOG were studied. Theoretically, enabling caching would directly impact the following


\begin{itemize}
    \item[Publisher Interest Rate]
    \item[Subscriber Round Trip Times]
    \item[Remote Update Deltas]  
\end{itemize}


ROUND TRIP TIMES WITHOUT DEAD RECKONING ARE ALMOST ENTIRELY DEPENDENT ON LOCALPLAYERSTAUTS PUBLISH RATE!!!!
\subsection{Effects of Interest Aggregation}
This is really not working the way I thought it would be :/
Compare interests received for each node's status to sum of interests expressed towards that node by all other nodes


\subsection{Effects of Forwarding Strategy}
Multicast shouldn't make a difference in tree like topology if interests are aggregated as there is only one upstream node from each route to a data source as defined by NLSR. On square however, producers should see all of the interests provided their local NFD's don't aggregate the interest which they dont seem to be.
