\chapter{Related Work}
\section{Background}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Existing IP based internet: host abstraction, where it comes from
    \item How it has scaled
    \item What it supports / doesn't support (mutlicast etc)
    \item History of ICN (CCN --> NDN, Parc etc)
\end{itemize}


\subsection{ICN Motivation}
\begin{itemize}
    \item VoCCN  has some good quoutes
    \item Hierarchical naming
    \item Mapping IP to ICN (VoCCN notes)
    \item Security (data rather than channel)!
    \item Content Dissemination
    \item Tradeoffs with IP
    \item Runs on anything (easy deployment incrementally)
\end{itemize}


\section{State-of-the-Art}

\subsection{NDN}
\begin{itemize}
    \item NDN Naming
    \item Structure of NDN Packets
    \item FIB, PIT, CS
    \item NFD
    \item Caching
    \item Routing
    \item Security!
    \item Multipath forwarding (not spanning tree, loop detection)
    \item NDN Tools, Libraries and Frameworks etc
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Real Time Applications using NDN}
\begin{itemize}
    \item How might it handle inherently host based communications (e.g. voice, converence calls)
    \item VoCCN + other papers
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Distributed Dataset Syncrhonization}
\begin{itemize}
    \item History of sync
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Video Game Architectures}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Architectures (C/S, P2P, Hybrid)
    \item Challenges
\end{itemize}
