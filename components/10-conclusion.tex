\chapter{Conclusion}

\subsection{Future Work}\label{sec:conc:fw}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item More rhobust interaction API, concurrent issues (e.g. two people shoot block at same time?)
    \item Add support for NPCs - shouldn't be hard. Main interesting bit is distributing the set of NPCs across game players. Other than that its just another sync object
    \item Outstanding interaction interest as described in the interaction api 
    \item IP based backend module
    \item Find a way to intelligently set freshness periods. Talk about how 20ms was okay in this case but can cause players to permanently lag in large topologies with lots of hops
\end{enumerate}


Things can't be parametrized in NDN without forming a gross name schema - e.g. interaction API can't send parameters. Potential solution is to have publisher's maintain outstanding interests towards consumers for interactions?
