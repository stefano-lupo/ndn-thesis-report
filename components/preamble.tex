I would like to thank everyone that I worked with on the Email-Sending-Infrastructure team at HubSpot, especially the team's technical lead Michael O'Brien who provided answers to the many questions that I had throughout the course of my internship.


I would also like to thank my academic liaison Prof. Owen Conlan for the guidance he has given in regard to the academic side of the internship.
