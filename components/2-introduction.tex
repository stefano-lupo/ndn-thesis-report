Today, most networks make use of the so called Internet Protocol (IP) as the primary mechanism for global communication. The design of IP was heavily influenced by the success of the 20th century telephone networks, resulting in a protocol tailored towards point-to-point communication between two hosts. IP is the \textit{universal network layer} of today's Internet, which implements the minimum functionality required for global interconnectivity. This represents the so called \textit{thin waist} of the Internet, upon which many of the vital systems in use today are built \cite{ndn-exec-summary}. The design of IP was paramount in the success of the modern day internet. However, in recent years, the Internet has become used in a variety of new non point-to-point contexts, rendering the inherent host based abstraction of IP less than ideal.  

The Named Data Networking project is a continuation of an earlier project known as Content-Centric Networking (CCN) \cite{vj-named-content}. The CCN and NDN projects represent a shift in how networks are designed, from the host-centric approach of IP to a data centric approach. NDN provides an alternative to IP, maintaining many of they key features which made it so successful, while improving on the shortcomings uncovered after three decades of use. The design of NDN aligns with the \textit{thin waist} ideology of today's Internet and NDN strives to be the universal network layer of tomorrow's Internet. 

% Typically, today's applications are written in terms of what information they want, rather than where it is located, requiring application-specific middleware to map between the application's data model and the Internet's data model \cite{ndn-project}. As the Internet has evolved, it has become a primary channel for content distribution
