\subsection{Further Work}
More rhobust interaction API, concurrent issues (e.g. two people shoot block at same time?)

Things can't be parametrized in NDN without forming a gross name schema - e.g. interaction API can't send parameters. Potential solution is to have publisher's maintain outstanding interests towards consumers for interactions?
