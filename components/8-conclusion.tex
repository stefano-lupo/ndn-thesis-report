\chapter{Conclusion}

\subsection{Further Work}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item More rhobust interaction API, concurrent issues (e.g. two people shoot block at same time?)
    \item Add support for NPCs - shouldn't be hard. Main interesting bit is distributing the set of NPCs across game players. Other than that its just another sync object
\end{enumerate}


Things can't be parametrized in NDN without forming a gross name schema - e.g. interaction API can't send parameters. Potential solution is to have publisher's maintain outstanding interests towards consumers for interactions?
