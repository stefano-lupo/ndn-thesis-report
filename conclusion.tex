\chapter{Conclusion}
In conclusion, the internship provided a fantastic insight into how software is developed in an enterprise environment and provided ample opportunity to learn new concepts and extend knowledge on previously studied topics. 

Over the course of the internship, experience was gained working with a variety of new and exciting technologies such as Kafka (\refsec{sec:kafka}) and Hadoop (\refsec{sec:hadoop}). Knowledge gained from previous modules of the course on fundamental computer science principles, problems and techniques (for example immutability, dependency injection, databases and distributed systems) was put into practice and used to deliver industry standard, well tested software that is used millions of times per day in a production environment.

The internship also provided an opportunity to practice and improve upon softer skills such as time management, time estimation for software development tasks, hosting and contributing to meetings with other engineers and reviewing code submitted by teammates. Although modules aiding in developing these fundamental industry skills are available throughout the MAI program, having the chance to use these skills on a daily basis provides an excellent means of improving these skills in a real enterprise environment.
